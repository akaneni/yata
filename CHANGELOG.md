# Changelog

What changed in each version of Yata. The full notes (installing, checking the file and known limitations) are on [GitHub releases](https://github.com/akaneni/yata/releases), in Portuguese.

## 0.7.1 — 2026-10-29

- **The microphone dot no longer gets stuck.** Windows sometimes doesn't say an app stopped using the microphone, and the orange dot stayed on with nobody recording. While an app is shown, Yata now checks again every few seconds.
- **The clock stays centered.** With the camera or microphone dot on, the clock moved a few pixels to the right; the notch now grows evenly on both sides.

## 0.7.0 — 2026-10-28

- **You can tell which agent it is.** Claude, Cursor and Codex show up with their own logo in the notch alert, the bubble and the activity list.
- **A status badge.** Done, failed and needs you now show as a small badge (✓, ✗, !) in the corner of the icon, instead of replacing it.
- **The bubble is a pill.** The source icon on one end and the ring, minutes or badge on the other, for meetings and focus too.
- **A clearer title.** An agent's activity is named after the program and the project, like `Orca · yata`.
- **AI in the privacy policy.** A new section says it plainly: Yata uses no AI model or service, and data from Google never goes to one.

## 0.6.0 — 2026-10-28

- **Smoother.** The notch opens, switches tabs and closes at your screen's refresh rate: on a 120 Hz monitor, opening went from about 36 to 115 frames per second, with the same memory. Closing is quicker than opening, and the notch no longer goes blank halfway through.
- **Calm motion.** **Settings → General → Calm motion** opens and closes the notch without the spring's bounce.
- **Same width on every tab.** Switching tabs only changes the height, and between tabs of the same height the notch holds still while the page slides. The lyrics moved under the player instead of widening the notch.
- **A fuller Focus tab.** Pick the task the session is for, from the Tasks tab, and tick it off right there. Beside it, today's focus against a daily goal (2 h by default, in **Settings → Focus**) and the last 7 days. The status line tells when the break comes and, with Google Calendar connected, how many sessions fit before the next meeting.
- **Polish.** Even spacing on every tab, buttons that fade in on hover and sink a little when clicked, and the Shelf in even columns.
- **Day to day:**
  - a time zone change on a trip moves the clock and the reminders right away;
  - a focus session pauses while the PC sleeps, instead of counting the sleep as focus;
  - the calendar and Google Tasks catch up when the PC wakes or the network comes back;
  - a microphone in use counts as you being there, so a call doesn't make Yata think you left;
  - a Shelf file on a drive or server that doesn't answer stays, dimmed, instead of disappearing;
  - a hand-edited or partly damaged `data.json` is fixed on load instead of keeping Yata from starting.

## 0.5.0 — 2026-10-28

- **Out of your calls.** Teams, Meet, Zoom, OBS and screenshots don't capture the notch, while you still see it: your next meeting, your tasks and your agent's project don't show up for others. On by default; it can be turned off in **Settings → General**.
- **The chime comes with the reminder.** A reminder that waited for a full-screen game chimes when it shows, not in the middle of the match. While your microphone is in use, or Windows asks not to be disturbed, reminders come without the chime. The chime can be turned off in **Settings → Notch notices**.
- **No late notices.** A reminder that waited and is no longer true, like "Standup in 5 min" after the meeting started, is dropped.
- **Welcome.** The first time, Settings open with what the notch can do and the choices that are yours. Water reminders now start off on new installs, and the tray menu has **Open Yata**.
- **Activities notch.** With the notch open, activities sit in a second notch beside it, each with a button to go to its window and one to dismiss it.
- **Ctrl+Alt+J** (off by default) goes to the window of what needs you and, pressed again, to the next one.
- **Safer updates.** Once Yata is code-signed, it only installs updates signed by the same publisher. The installer also checks Microsoft's signature before installing .NET.
- **Fixes:**
  - "ligar às 9h" (Portuguese for "call at 9") becomes a reminder;
  - **Join** recognizes Teams' new links and Outlook Safe Links;
  - a network hiccup no longer leaves a song without lyrics for 3 days;
  - the update button no longer gets stuck on "Downloading…";
  - an agent that works for a long time no longer drops out of the bubble.

## 0.4.0 — 2026-10-27

- **From the notch to the agent's terminal.** When Claude Code, Codex or a script needs you, a click on the bubble brings up the terminal or editor it runs in. You approve or deny in the tool itself: Yata never decides for the agent.
- **Settings → AI agents.** Turns the Claude Code, Cursor and Codex hooks on and off (WSL included) without editing files, backing up each config first.
- **Now, without waiting.** **Check now** looks for a new version, **↻** reads Google right away and **Update now** fetches the weather.
- The bubble no longer runs away from the mouse, and the notch opens when the mouse stops on it.

## 0.3.0 — 2026-10-27

- **A bubble beside the notch.** While music plays, the Pomodoro countdown and the next meeting move to a second, small notch, one thing at a time, by priority.
- **Activities from other programs.** `yata-cli` lets scripts, builds and downloads show their progress in the bubble.
- **AI agents in the notch.** Claude Code, Cursor and Codex show as working, waiting for you and done, one bubble per session. Only the state reaches the notch, never prompts, commands or answers.
- **Notices that aren't lost.** Reminders that come while the notch is open or in full screen wait and show one at a time.

## 0.2.1 — 2026-10-27

- **Update and restart.** With the new version notice on, updating takes one click: the installer comes from GitHub and is checked against its published SHA-256.
- **Google Tasks right away.** With the Tasks tab open, changes in Google Tasks show up within about 15 seconds.
- **Build provenance.** Each installer carries a record signed by GitHub that ties it to the code that built it.

## 0.2.0 — 2026-10-27

- **English and Portuguese**, following the Windows language or your choice.
- **Settings with a sidebar**, **Undo** when removing tasks or clearing the shelf, and choice menus.
- **Accessibility:** keyboard in Settings, names for screen readers, less motion when Windows asks for it, and more contrast.
- **A smaller installer:** from 6 MB to about 2.6 MB.
